# omacosy-daily

A personal build of [omacosy](https://github.com/paulsp94/omacosy) by
Paul Spende. It is the build I run every day. It adds fixes and
features, and I offer each one that fits upstream as a pull request.
[FORK.md](FORK.md) lists what it adds.

**It takes no contributions.** Open issues and pull requests at
[paulsp94/omacosy](https://github.com/paulsp94/omacosy).

omakase + macOS + cosy. An [omarchy](https://omarchy.org)-style setup
for macOS: tiling window management with a real Super key and
Hyprland's dwindle layout, a status bar built for it (bar, popups,
sliders and screen dimming in one process), focus follows mouse,
trackpad workspace swipes, a Mission-Control-style workspace overview
with live previews, focused-window border rings, and one theme switch
that covers everything down to the wallpaper. All of it installs from
this one repo.

![The omacosy desktop — themed bar over the osaka-jade wallpaper](docs/screenshots/desktop.jpg)

The whole environment idles at about **157MB** of memory. Numbers per
process in [Memory use](#memory-use).

Most of it is eight small binaries (Swift and C) built by the installer,
because several of the existing tools are broken on macOS 26. The
details are under [What's inside](#whats-inside).

## Where it runs

| Setup | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Apple silicon, macOS 27, one display with no notch | runs every day on a MacBook Air M1, under AeroSpace and under OmniWM |
| macOS 26 (Tahoe) | supported. Upstream omacosy is built and measured on macOS 26.3, and this build keeps that code |
| A MacBook with a notch | supported in the code, and not yet run on a notched MacBook. The six things it does differently are listed below |
| An external monitor, or two displays | supported in the code: each display gets its own nine workspaces. Upstream runs it docked to a second display. This build is tested on one display: the MacBook Air M1 drives only one external display, so two external displays need other hardware. A test on a Mac mini with two displays is in progress |
| An Intel Mac | not supported. `install.sh` builds the gesture daemon and the OmniWM client for Apple silicon only |
| `./uninstall.sh` | tested in a sandbox, for every starting state of `~/.zshrc`. Not yet run on a real Mac |

The first tests on a notched MacBook and of `uninstall.sh` use release
`v1.0.0`. Their results go into this section.

### On a MacBook with a notch

The code reads the notch height of each display from macOS, so a notched
built-in display and a flat external monitor each get their own layout.
On a notched display it does six things differently. Each one is written,
and each one waits for its first run on a notched MacBook:

1. The bar stays visible at rest. macOS already keeps the camera strip
   out of the space windows use, so hiding the bar there gains nothing.
   The default, `autohide=off` in `bar.conf`, keeps it visible on every
   display; `autohide=auto` also keeps it visible on a notched one.
2. The top gap for windows subtracts the notch height, so tiled windows
   start just below the bar and not one notch lower.
3. The media pill sits at the left edge, because the camera takes the
   centre of the strip.
4. The media title is cut at 20 characters, not 28.
5. At the top edge, the native menu bar comes down over the bar, so its
   menus and status icons are reachable. The bar rests below the native
   menu bar and above other apps' windows.
6. A fullscreen window starts below the camera strip, and the strip is
   painted black, so fullscreen looks complete.

## What install.sh changes on your Mac

Read this before you run it.

- It installs Homebrew if it is missing, then the packages in `Brewfile`:
  AeroSpace, Karabiner-Elements, Ghostty, Raycast, a Nerd Font and a
  set of command-line tools.
- It writes `~/.zshrc` as a short stub. A `~/.zshrc` you had before is
  backed up and copied to `~/.zshrc.local`, which keeps loading.
- It replaces `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json` to make Caps Lock the
  Super key. Karabiner-Elements runs as root; see
  [What it does not do](#what-it-does-not-do).
- It hides the native menu bar and turns off the four-finger swipe
  gestures of macOS, so the bar and the swipe daemon can take them.
- It builds its helpers into `~/.local/bin` and starts them as launch
  agents.

It records each change in a manifest, and `./uninstall.sh` reverses
exactly those changes.

## Fresh Mac

The same command installs and reinstalls. It clones the repo, or updates
the clone that is already there, then runs the installer:

```sh
d=~/.local/share/omacosy
if [ -d "$d/.git" ]; then git -C "$d" pull --ff-only; else git clone https://github.com/datarip/omacosy-daily.git "$d"; fi &&
cd "$d" && ./install.sh
```

Upstream omacosy already in `~/.local/share/omacosy`? Run its
`./uninstall.sh`, delete that folder, then run the command above.

Put your own apps and values in `~/.config/omacosy/settings.conf`.
`install.sh` applies them at every run; to apply a change at once, run
`omacosy-settings`. See [Your own settings](#your-own-settings).

This installs AeroSpace. For [OmniWM](#two-window-managers-omniwm-option-beta)
instead, run `./install.sh --omniwm`: AeroSpace is then not installed.
A later `install.sh` or `omacosy-update` keeps the window manager you
chose.

The clone location matters. Configs are symlinked into the repo, and
macOS privacy (TCC) blocks launchd services from reading `~/Documents`,
`~/Desktop` and `~/Downloads`. If you clone there anyway, the installer
falls back to copying configs; that still works, but edits then need an
`install.sh` re-run to apply.

The installer is idempotent. It installs Homebrew if missing, runs
`brew bundle`, compiles the helper binaries, generates the AeroSpace
config from your app choices, symlinks configs (backing up anything it
would replace), hides the native menu bar, applies the default theme,
and starts the services.

See [Permissions](#permissions) for the grants it asks of you, what
each one is used for, and what breaks without it. Karabiner-Elements
also asks you to approve its driver extension.

## Updating

```sh
omacosy-update          # pull, then re-run the installer
omacosy-update --check  # just say whether there is anything new
```

`install.sh` rebuilds only the binaries whose sources changed and
restarts their agents, so an update is a pull plus a re-run, and this
command wraps both. It refuses a clone with local edits, and refuses
one whose branch has diverged, rather than deciding either for you.

The installer resets the files your settings go into, and then runs
`omacosy-settings`, which puts your values back.

There is no background update check. The bar makes exactly one network
call (the weather), and a daemon polling GitHub on a timer would
quietly make that two. Nothing here contacts the network unless you
run it.

## Permissions

A window manager needs broad permissions, so here is the whole list:
every grant, which binary asks, what it is used for, and what you lose
by refusing it. Everything is refusable; the parts that depend on a
grant hide themselves rather than half-work.

| Grant | Who asks | What it does | Without it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Accessibility** | AeroSpace *or* OmniWM, `omacosy-gesture`, `omacosy-bar` (reads the focused app's menus for the app-pill popup), `omacosy-ffm` (AeroSpace mode only), `omacosy-borders` (optional; hears the ringed window close) | Move, resize and focus other apps' windows. This is the tiling itself, and it is the broadest permission here. The focus ring uses it only to hear an app report that the ringed window is closing. | Nothing tiles. Not optional in practice. Without it for `omacosy-borders` alone, the ring leaves a window closed with Cmd-W about 0.25 s later. |
| **Input Monitoring** | Karabiner-Elements, `omacosy-gesture` (and OmniWM, under that option) | Karabiner reads keys to remap Caps Lock; `omacosy-gesture` reads raw trackpad contacts, because macOS 26 stopped carrying touch data in normal events. | No Super key, no swipe gestures. |
| **Screen Recording** | the program that first starts `omacosy-overview` ([see below](#permissions)), `omacosy-bar` | Overview captures a thumbnail per window for its cards, including windows the window manager has stashed offscreen, which a screenshot of the visible screen could not see. The bar samples the native menu bar's colour once, so an auto-hiding bar can paint it on the first frame instead of resolving a blur on every reveal. | Cards fall back to app icons and titles; the bar falls back to a live blur, which reveals more slowly and matches the menu bar less exactly. |
| **Bluetooth** | `omacosy-bar` | Reads adapter power and the paired-device list for the bluetooth pill and its menu. | The pill hides itself. |
| **Location** | `omacosy-bar` | Reads **only** the wi-fi network's name, which macOS classes as location data. No coordinate is ever requested; the authorisation itself is what unlocks `CWInterface.ssid()`. | The wi-fi popup's title row reads "wi-fi" instead of your network's name. Everything else is unaffected. |
| **Automation** | `omacosy-bar`, `theme-set` | Apple Events to **Spotify** (what is playing; play/pause/next from the media pill) and to **System Events** (sleep, lock and restart from the Apple menu; setting the wallpaper). | The media pill hides; those menu rows do nothing. |
| **Automation (Finder)** | `omacosy-finder-window` | Apple Events to **Finder**, to open a new Finder window on the current workspace (Super+Shift+F). macOS asks on the first press. | Super+Shift+F opens no window. |
| **Files and Folders** | `omacosy-bar` | Only if your clone lives in `~/Documents`, `~/Desktop` or `~/Downloads`. The bar reads its palette from the theme directory inside the repo, and macOS walls launchd agents off from those folders. | The bar **hangs at startup** waiting on the prompt. Clone to `~/.local/share/omacosy` and this never comes up. |

More on **Location**, because it sounds worse than it is: it buys
exactly one string. The bar requests authorisation and then reads
`ssid()`. It never asks for a position, holds no coordinate and starts
no location updates. Two things are required and neither alone is
enough: measured on macOS 26.3, an unbundled binary reads `nil` however
it is authorised, which is why the bar ships inside a minimal `.app`.
Refuse the grant and you lose the name, nothing else.

More on **Screen Recording**, because the entry that counts is not the
one you would expect. `omacosy-overview` takes the thumbnails, but it keeps
running in the background after it first opens, and macOS holds the program
that started it that first time responsible for every later opening too.
Observed in macOS's permission log on macOS 27.2, with the overview started
fresh each time: `omacosy-gesture` when a four-finger swipe up started it,
Karabiner-Elements (`Karabiner-Console-User-Server`) when Super+O started it
under OmniWM, and the overview's own entry not consulted. Those are the
entries to switch on. An overview first started from a terminal answers to
that terminal's entry until it stops. Under AeroSpace, Super+O does
something else, and the swipe is the only way in.

The bar asks for Screen Recording only when it auto-hides: it then samples
the native menu bar at a hover, once for each new wallpaper, and macOS
shows its dialog at the first one. With `autohide=off` it never asks.

### What it does not do

- **No telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporting.** Nothing is sent
  anywhere about you or this machine.
- **One network call**, ever: `https://wttr.in/?format=j1` on a long
  timer, for the weather pill. wttr.in infers your city from the IP the
  request arrives on; no coordinates are gathered or sent, and the bar
  holds no location API. Delete the weather pill and nothing leaves the
  machine.
- **The focus ring only listens.** `omacosy-borders` asks for
  Accessibility to hear an app report that the ringed window is closing.
  It reads the app's window list and registers for that one report on
  that one window. It never clicks, types, moves a window or reads what a
  window shows. Refuse the grant and the ring still works; a window
  closed with Cmd-W keeps its ring about 0.25 s longer.
- **omacosy's own binaries never run as root.** `install.sh` uses no
  sudo, installs no LaunchDaemon, and every helper it builds runs as
  you, in your login session.
- **Karabiner-Elements does run as root, and you should know that
  before installing.** It is a Homebrew dependency here, purely to turn
  Caps Lock into Super. It ships a DriverKit system extension plus
  daemons that run as root (`Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Daemon`,
  `Karabiner-Core-Service`); that is what the driver-extension approval
  during install is. It is the most privileged thing this repo puts on
  your Mac, and it is third-party. Skip it if that trade is wrong for
  you; you lose the Super key and keep everything else.
- **Nothing here reads your keystrokes.** No omacosy binary opens a
  keyboard event tap. Only Karabiner sees keys, which is inherent to
  remapping one. `omacosy-gesture`'s event tap is gesture-only and
  listen-only (`1 << NSEventTypeGesture`, `kCGEventTapOptionListenOnly`),
  so it cannot see or alter a keystroke. Debug logs
  (`/tmp/omacosy-*.log`) carry window titles, app names and workspace
  numbers, never input.

### Keep your permissions across updates

macOS keeps each permission with the program's code signature. With an
Apple Development certificate on this Mac, `install.sh` signs every
helper with it, and an update keeps all your permissions. Without one,
macOS treats each rebuilt helper as a new app, and you grant its
permissions again after an update. omacosy works either way, and
`install.sh` ends with a warning while no certificate signs.

To add a certificate (free, needs an Apple ID):

1. Install Xcode from the App Store and open it once.
2. Xcode → Settings → Accounts: add your Apple ID.
3. Select it, then **Manage Certificates → + → Apple Development**.
4. Run `./install.sh` again, or `omacosy-update`.

You can do this before or after installing omacosy. The next install
signs with the certificate. macOS then asks once more for each
permission, because the signature changed; after that, no update asks
again.

If `install.sh` says the certificate cannot sign because Apple's G3
certificate is missing, answer `y` when it offers to add it, or add it
yourself:

```sh
cd /tmp && curl -fsSLO https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/AppleWWDRCAG3.cer
security add-certificates -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db AppleWWDRCAG3.cer
```

## Your own settings

Your values live in one file outside the clone,
`~/.config/omacosy/settings.conf`. `install.sh` copies it from
`config/settings.template.conf` once, and never overwrites it.

| Setting | What it sets |
| --- | --- |
| `TERMINAL`, `BROWSER`, `EMAIL`, `MUSIC`, `MESSENGER` | the apps the launch chords open. The defaults are Ghostty, Spotify and Slack; an empty `BROWSER` or `EMAIL` makes that chord follow the Mac's default web browser or mail app (how to change those is in [docs/customising.md](docs/customising.md)) |
| `APP_WORKSPACE_RULES` | the workspace an app's windows open on |
| `APP_FLOAT_RULES` | the windows that float instead of tile, under OmniWM |
| `RING_RADIUS`, `WINDOW_CORNER` | the focus ring radius, and the radius macOS draws window corners with. The whole Settings dashboard follows the same corner — buttons, toggles, dropdowns, chips, the palette swatches and the colour wells, plus the card and its theme thumbnails — and so do the `Super+K` cheatsheet and the popup panel under a bar pill. The bar's own pills and the workspace overview stay rounded by choice |
| `BORDER_WIDTH` | how thick the borders are: `small`, `medium` or `large` (1, 2 or 3 px). One value is shared by the focused-window ring, the `Super+K` cheatsheet, the Settings dashboard and the Theme Studio editor, which is what the Options tab's **Borders** row (S/M/L) writes. The menu bar, its dropdown popups and the workspace overview keep their own borders |
| `AUTOHIDE` | whether the bar hides at rest: `off`, `on` or `auto`. `omacosy-bar-autohide` keeps it current, so your choice survives a reinstall |
| `SERIALIZE_APP_SPAWNS` | one window at a time from a burst of presses on the music and messenger chords |
| `GHOSTTY_WINDOW_SHADOW` | whether Ghostty draws its macOS window shadow (`on`, Ghostty's default, or `off`). Off removes the black rim a shadow makes around a dark, translucent Ghostty window under a tiling window manager; applies on the next Ghostty launch. `""` leaves Ghostty's default |
| `LOGO_INTRO` | the effect the `Super+,` dashboard plays over its wordmark when it opens — `laseretch`, `sweep`, `waves`, `middleout`, `scattered`, `print`, `decrypt`, `errorcorrect`, `rain`, `crumble`, `expand`, `highlight`, `colorshift`, `beams`, `slice`, `wipe` or `spray`. Empty or `random` picks a different one each open, never repeating the last; each run lasts about half a second to just over a second. Reduce Motion skips the intro |

`install.sh` regenerates the window-manager configs on each run, then
runs `omacosy-settings`, which writes your values back into them. After
an edit, run `omacosy-settings` to apply it at once. A file that still
equals the template is left alone, because it holds only examples. Set the apps in
`settings.conf`, not in `config/apps.local.conf`: `omacosy-settings`
rewrites that file. [docs/customising.md](docs/customising.md) explains
each setting, how to find an app's bundle id, and what survives a
re-install.

Your own shell config belongs in `~/.zshrc.local`. `install.sh` writes
`~/.zshrc` once, as a short stub that loads the repo's `zshrc`, and that
file loads `~/.zshrc.local`.

## Settings

`Super`+`,` opens a cheatsheet-style modal — the same card as `Super`+`k` —
with seven tabs:

- **Options** — the window manager (AeroSpace or OmniWM), window & UI corners,
  menu-bar mode, fullscreen, terminal auto-theme, and a global **Hide NSFW
  Content** switch.
- **Workspaces** — which apps open on which workspace, per display, with a
  searchable picker. **Save** writes `~/.config/omacosy/settings.conf`, runs
  `omacosy-settings`, and drops any app rule you removed (under OmniWM that
  also prunes the manager's own rule).
- **Themes** — every theme as a card with its colours; click one to apply it.
  Your own wallpapers appear below the stock themes as `Wallpaper #N`;
  the theme in use carries a green **Active** pill, each saved variation
  gets a named card of its own, and its picture
  carries a `· N variation(s)` badge. Hovering a card shows its pill —
  **Edit** reopens a saved variation, **Customize** starts a new one from
  a wallpaper in the Theme Editor — and a small **trash**. The trash asks
  before removing: the wallpaper **file goes to the Finder Trash**, and its
  saved variations can be deleted at the same time.
- **Wallpapers** — browses **wallhaven.cc**: a search row (query, sorting,
  order), category and purity chips, a resolution dropdown, **More Filters**
  (colour and ratio), S/M/L cards and a results count. It fetches three pages
  at once as you scroll, caching thumbnails on disk, and shows each picture's
  resolution and size. Hover a card for **save**, **bookmark**,
  **bulk-select** and **download**; downloads land in the wallpaper folder as
  the next `Wallpaper #N`, with a green check when they arrive and nothing
  switching on its own. A bulk download retries a rate-limited or interrupted
  file with a growing random wait, and a file that still fails keeps its tick
  so **Download** offers exactly the failures again. A **Bookmarked** filter
  shows saved pictures.
- **Storage** — the local wallpapers folder (where it is, a button that opens
  it, **Add Images**, **Set Folder**) and a **Thumbnail Cache** row with its
  size, a **Clear Cache** button and a button that opens the cache folder.
  Clearing also drops the dashboard's colour-strip cache; both rebuild as the
  tabs are opened again.
- **API Keys** — the wallhaven.cc API key, masked, stored locally.
- **Update** — `omacosy-update --check`, with the install button behind it.

It reads and writes the same files and commands as the CLI, so the window and
the shell can never disagree, and it follows the theme palette — its wordmark,
the lists and their scrollbars included, and the selection highlight and focus
ring of every editable field. Opening it brings the wordmark alive:
one of seventeen short effects, picked at random and never repeating the last
(`LOGO_INTRO` in `settings.conf` pins one). Up and Down scroll a list, Left and
Right move between tabs, and the app picker highlights the row under the
keyboard or the pointer and applies it on Return; a theme card takes an accent
ring under the pointer. `bin/omacosy-dashboard` is a single-instance launcher:
the first press opens it, later presses toggle the one window it owns.

## Commands

The commands you run:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `omacosy-settings` | applies `~/.config/omacosy/settings.conf`. `install.sh` runs it; run it yourself after an edit |
| `omacosy-update [--check]` | pulls this repo and runs `install.sh` again |
| `omacosy-wm-switch omniwm\|aerospace` | moves this Mac from one window manager to the other |
| `omacosy-toggle [on\|off]` | parks the whole setup without uninstalling it. No argument flips |
| `omacosy-bar-autohide on\|off\|auto\|status` | sets whether the bar hides at rest, and the top gap that goes with it |
| `omacosy-solo-fullscreen on\|off\|status` | a workspace with one tiled window fills the display. Off by default |
| `omacosy-window-corners [square\|round\|<radius>] [--width <1\|2\|3>]` | sets the radius macOS draws window corners with; the whole Settings dashboard (buttons, toggles, swatches, the colour wells, the card and its theme thumbnails), the `Super+K` cheatsheet and the popup panel under a bar pill follow it, while the bar's pills and the overview stay rounded. `--width` (1 small, 2 medium, 3 large) sets the border width shared by the focused-window ring, the `Super+K` cheatsheet, the Settings dashboard and the Theme Studio editor, and re-syncs the ring radius; the menu bar, its dropdown popups and the overview keep their borders. No argument shows it |
| `omacosy-ghostty-shadow on\|off\|status` | Ghostty's own macOS window shadow (`macos-window-shadow`). `off` removes the black rim a shadow makes around a dark, translucent Ghostty window under a tiling window manager; recorded in `settings.conf` as `GHOSTTY_WINDOW_SHADOW`, applied on the next Ghostty launch. No argument shows it |
| `omacosy-harvest-zshrc` | moves the lines installers appended to `~/.zshrc` into `~/.zshrc.local` |
| `omacosy-term-auto-theme on\|off\|status` | whether the terminal and its tools follow the wallpaper theme. Off by default; the desktop, the bar, the ring and the cheat sheet always follow |
| `theme-set <name>` | switches the whole theme |
| `theme-next` | the next theme (Super+Shift+T) |
| `theme-bg-next [path]` | the next wallpaper of the theme, or the image you name (Super+Shift+B) |
| `omacosy-theme-switch theme\|wallpaper` | what Super+Shift+T and B run: the theme and the wallpaper change instantly and in sync (see Themes) |
| `omacosy-dashboard` | Super+,: opens Settings, or toggles it closed if it is already open |

The keys and the daemons run these. You do not need to run them:

| Command | Run by |
| --- | --- |
| `omacosy-ws` | Super+1..9, Super+Shift+1..9 and Super+Tab: the workspace slots of the focused display |
| `omacosy-cycle` | Alt+Tab, under AeroSpace: the windows of this workspace |
| `omacosy-float` | Super+S, under AeroSpace: the next floating window |
| `omacosy-layout` | Super+J, Super+- and Super+=, under AeroSpace: split direction and resize |
| `omacosy-spawn`, `omacosy-spawn-cmd` | the launch chords: one new window at a time |
| `omacosy-browser` | Super+Shift+Return: opens the macOS default web browser, or `BROWSER` when set |
| `omacosy-open` | opens a URL, a file, or a scheme (`mailto`) with its macOS default app. Super+Shift+E runs `omacosy-open mailto` for mail |
| `omacosy-finder-window` | Super+Shift+F: a new Finder window on this workspace |
| `omacosy-files` | Super+Shift+Y: yazi in a new terminal window |
| `omacosy-term-auto-theme apply` | `theme-set`, `theme-bg-next` and `omacosy-theme-switch`, after every switch |
| `omacosy-theme-switch` | Super+Shift+T and Super+Shift+B: the instant, synced switch |
| `omacosy-focus-guard` | AeroSpace, on each workspace change: it undoes a switch that an app caused by activating itself |
| `omacosy-ws-collapse` | the bar, when a display is unplugged or plugged back in |
| `omacosy-karabiner-omniwm` | `omacosy-wm-switch` and `omacosy-settings`: the launch chords under OmniWM |

Why so much of it is self-built:

- **AutoRaise** broke on macOS 26 (cooperative activation), so
  `omacosy-ffm` focuses windows through the same SkyLight calls
  AeroSpace uses.
- **aerospace-swipe** broke because CGEvent taps stopped carrying
  multi-touch data on macOS 26.3. We fixed it (raw MultitouchSupport
  frames) and offered the fixes upstream as
  [#29](https://github.com/acsandmann/aerospace-swipe/pull/29) and
  [#30](https://github.com/acsandmann/aerospace-swipe/pull/30); once
  the daemon had to serve both window managers and carried more of
  our patches than upstream commits, the engine moved in-tree as
  `omacosy-gesture` (MIT notice kept).
- **JankyBorders** keeps a bitmap per window and costs hundreds of MB.
  `omacosy-borders` strokes one CAShapeLayer that the WindowServer
  rasterizes, driven by SkyLight notifications for focus, move and
  resize, so the ring glides with drags without polling. With
  Accessibility it also hears an app report that the ringed window is
  closing, so the ring is gone before the window starts to fade.
- **Mission Control** cannot see AeroSpace's virtual workspaces, so a
  workspace overview cannot be had any other way than
  `omacosy-overview` capturing them itself.
- **`omacosy-helper`** covers wallpaper setting (System Events
  scripting half-broke in macOS 14+), CoreAudio output switching,
  IOBluetooth control, cursor position, per-display notch detection,
  the default browser and mail app bundle ids, and the dwindle split hint.
- **`omacosy-bar`** holds the window model in memory and subscribes to
  the system's own publishers: SkyLight for window churn, IOBluetooth
  for connects, SCDynamicStore for the network, IOPS for battery,
  CoreAudio for volume, DisplayServices for brightness, Spotify's own
  broadcast for the track. It polls for nothing macOS announces; its
  only timers are the weather fetch and the clock. A workspace switch
  repaints in 2.5 ms because it asks no one anything; the shell bar it
  replaced took 164 ms to answer the same event.

## The bar

One process draws all of it: bar, popups and sliders are surfaces of
`helper/bar.swift`. Transparent bar, everything a flat radius-4 pill.
A popup stays open while the pointer is anywhere in the bar or the
popup, and closes when it is in neither. The bar hides itself when a
window takes the whole display, and comes back if you put the pointer
on the very top edge, so brightness and volume stay reachable mid-film
without leaving fullscreen. The climb happens only when a fullscreen
window actually covers the bar — otherwise the top edge belongs to the
auto-hidden native menu bar, which reveals ABOVE the bar and stays
clickable (app menus were unreachable before that fix). It drops back
behind everything when the pointer leaves. Under OmniWM the bar simply
stays visible in its reserved strip and never plays this game.

If the native menu bar ever gets stuck revealed over the bar (a
Tahoe bug, most often poked by a Focus mode's menu-bar icon),
`killall SystemUIServer` resets it.

### Hiding the bar, and the split top edge

`~/.config/omacosy/bar.conf` holds three settings. The bar reads the
file when it starts.

| Setting | Values | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autohide` | `off` (default), `auto`, `on` | `off` keeps the bar visible on every display. `auto` keeps it visible on a notched display, and hides it at rest on a display with no notch or on an external monitor. `on` hides it at rest everywhere |
| `split` | `0.0` to `1.0` | where the top edge divides, as a fraction of the display width. The left part belongs to this bar, the right part to the native menu bar |
| `slide` | milliseconds, or `off` | how long the bar takes to slide in and out, on a display where it hides |

Change `autohide` with `omacosy-bar-autohide on|off|auto`. It also sets
the top gap for windows, and restarts the bar. An edit by hand sets the
bar but not the gap.

### Workspace icons

You can set workspace icons in the optional
`~/.config/omacosy/workspace-icons.conf` file. Each non-comment line has one
workspace name, an equals sign, and either one Unicode scalar or a reverse-DNS
application bundle identifier.

```
1 = ★
14 = ◆

4 = com.apple.Safari
```

The bar first uses a configured icon. It then uses the icon of the sole app on
that workspace, and finally shows the workspace's last digit. Exact workspace
names win. In this example, workspace `14` uses `◆`, not the `4` shorthand.
The shorthand applies only to multi-digit, all-numeric workspace names ending
in `1` through `9` when they have no valid exact declaration.

The bar reads the file once at startup. To apply an edit, restart it with:

```sh
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/com.omacosy.bar"
```

Malformed lines are logged and ignored. A well-formed bundle identifier that
does not resolve to an installed app is unavailable. It blocks shorthand for
that exact workspace, then the bar falls back to the sole app or the digit.
Image paths are unsupported because the bar resolves configured app icons at
startup and does no config-file or image-file I/O while it draws.

- **Apple menu**: the REAL one, read over Accessibility — About This
  Mac, System Settings, Recent Items (drills in, with app and
  file-type icons resolved locally since AX exposes none), Force Quit,
  the power verbs — plus omacosy's Next Theme at the bottom. Hidden
  hold-Option duplicates are collapsed; falls back to a hand-rolled
  list without the Accessibility grant.
- **App menus**: clicking the front-app pill drops that app's actual
  menu bar into a popup — File/Edit/… drill into their real items,
  nested submenus included, and clicking a leaf performs it directly
  via AXPress with no native menu ever appearing. Shortcuts sit
  right-aligned; enabled-state is not rendered because apps validate
  menu items only when a menu opens, so closed-menu reads lie. Menus
  taller than the screen scroll. The one thing the auto-hidden native
  bar still owned, gone.
- **Workspaces**: one segmented capsule per monitor showing only that
  monitor's workspaces; accent pill on the focused one; click to jump.
- **Media**: prev / play-pause / next + track title (Spotify). Centered
  on flat displays, left cluster on notched ones (per-display notch
  detection via `NSScreen.safeAreaInsets`), hidden when Spotify isn't
  running.
- **Bluetooth**: device menu (click to connect/disconnect), power
  toggle.
- **WiFi**: the pill is the icon alone; the popup names the network and
  adds ip and router, signal with a verdict, link rate and security
  generation, channel with its band and width. The name is in the popup
  because an SSID can be arbitrarily wide, and on a notched display a
  long one pushed the right cluster under the notch. The name needs the
  Location grant (see [Permissions](#permissions)).
- **Weather**: wttr.in, cached details popup.
- **Volume**: scroll adjusts, click opens slider + output-device menu,
  right-click mutes.
- **Brightness**: scroll adjusts, click opens a slider (DisplayServices,
  no deps). Scrolling past 0 keeps going: a **shade** dims the display
  below its hardware minimum by scaling gamma, so there is no overlay
  window in the z-order and screenshots come out normal. It survives
  sleep/wake and it reaches external displays, which have no backlight
  API. Gamma is reset when the setting process exits, so a crash or an
  uninstall restores the screen by itself.
- **Battery** / **Clock** (calendar popup) / **Activity** (floating
  btop).
- **Floats**: appears only while the workspace holds floating windows;
  click surfaces the next one.

Weather defaults to Celsius and uses the public IP address for location,
so it follows a VPN exit node. Override either preference without editing
the repo:

```bash
omacosy-weather unit fahrenheit
omacosy-weather location 10001
omacosy-weather location "Chicago"
omacosy-weather location auto       # follow the VPN/public IP again
omacosy-weather status
```

The command restarts only the bar so the next weather fetch uses the new
preference immediately. Settings live in `~/.config/omacosy/weather.json`.

## Keybindings — Super = hold Caps Lock

Karabiner remaps Caps Lock to `cmd+ctrl+alt` (a combo macOS never
uses), so omarchy's scheme works letter-for-letter without breaking
typing or app shortcuts. Caps Lock tapped alone is Escape.

A new keyboard whose Caps Lock still toggles caps: Karabiner leaves a
device alone when it also reports as a pointing device, which many
Hall-effect and Bluetooth boards do. Turn on **Modify events** for it in
Karabiner-Elements → Settings → Devices. `install.sh` keeps that switch
on re-runs and names such keyboards when it finds one connected.

| Chord | Action |
|---|---|
| **Navigation** | |
| `Super+1..9` | switch to this display's workspace N |
| `Super+tab` / `Super+shift+tab` | next / previous workspace, within this display's set |
| `Super+b` | back and forth between the last two workspaces |
| `Alt+tab` / `Alt+shift+tab` | cycle windows **on this workspace**, floats included |
| `Ctrl+Alt+tab` | cycle focus between displays |
| `Super+arrows` | focus the window in that direction |
| `Super+s` | surface the next floating window (and bring the cursor) |
| **Moving windows** | |
| `Super+shift+arrows` | AeroSpace: move the window in that direction. OmniWM: **swap** tiles (`ctrl+opt+shift+arrows` stacks into the neighbor as a group instead) |
| `Super+shift+1..9` | move the window to workspace N and follow it |
| `Super+shift+o` | throw the window to the same slot on the other display |
| `Super+shift+space` | throw the WHOLE workspace to the other display |
| **Layout** | |
| `Super+w` | close window |
| `Super+t` | toggle floating |
| `Super+j` | toggle split direction |
| `Super+-` / `Super+=` | resize |
| `Super+f` | zoom the focused window inside its workspace — the outer gaps and the bar strip stay, so it reads as one enlarged tile rather than true fullscreen (it stays in its workspace; swipes still reach it) |
| `Super+n` | native macOS fullscreen (a separate Space — outside the workspace model, avoid unless an app needs it) |
| `Super+r` | resize mode (`h/j/k/l`, `-`/`=`, `esc`) — AeroSpace only; OmniWM has no binding modes |
| `Super+shift+;` | service mode (`esc` reload, `r` flatten, `⌫` close others) |
| **Apps and system** | |
| `Super+enter` / `Super+shift+enter` | terminal / browser |
| `Super+space` | launcher (Raycast; the OmniWM option opens OmniWM's command palette instead) |
| `Super+shift+f` / `+m` / `+g` | files / music / messenger (set in `settings.conf`) |
| `Super+shift+y` | yazi, the terminal file manager, in a new window (after `./install.sh --yazi` or `--yazi-full`) |
| `Super+shift+t` | next theme |
| `Super+shift+b` | next wallpaper of the current theme |
| `Super+shift+l` | lock the screen |
| `Super+k` | keybinding cheatsheet (this table, rendered from the config) |
| `Super+,` | Settings — options, app→workspace assignment, and a theme gallery |

![The keybinding cheatsheet — every binding, parsed from aerospace.toml](docs/screenshots/cheatsheet.jpg)

Screenshots, clipboard and app switching stay macOS's own
(`Cmd+Shift+3/4/5`, `Cmd+C/V`, `Cmd+Tab`). `Alt+Tab` above is the
*window*-scoped switcher macOS lacks.

**On the modifier space.** omarchy layers `Super+Ctrl` and `Super+Alt`
on top of `Super`. This setup cannot: Super IS `cmd+ctrl+alt`, so those
modifiers are already spent and Shift is the only layer left, two
against omarchy's four. Bindings that would collide are re-homed by
mnemonic (lock is `Super+Shift+L`, not `Super+Ctrl+L`), and the
overflow lives in binding modes instead.

Each display owns an independent set of nine workspaces, omarchy style:
main holds 1–9, secondary holds 11–19. Same last digit means the same
slot, and the bar and overview render only the slot digit. `Super+N`
switches the focused monitor's slot N (via `omacosy-ws`);
`Super+Shift+N` moves the window to that slot; `Super+Shift+O` throws
the window to the same slot on the other monitor. Windows open on the
workspace you're on; nothing is auto-assigned by app.

**Unplugging folds the second display's workspaces into the first.**
AeroSpace parks 11–19 on the remaining display, but `Super+N` and
`Super+Tab` only match single-digit slots, so without help every window
on a secondary workspace would be stranded where no keybinding reaches
it. On a monitor-count change the bar runs `omacosy-ws-collapse`: each
occupied guest workspace empties into the lowest free 1–9 slot,
occupied slots are never touched, and every moved window is recorded
with its origin. Plug the display back in and they go home
individually, so anything you opened while undocked stays put.

## Themes

`theme-set <name>` switches everything at once: bar, borders, wallpaper
on every display, and any terminal that follows omarchy's
`~/.config/omarchy/current/theme` convention (the upstream author's does).
`Super+Shift+T` cycles.

`Super+Shift+T` and `Super+Shift+B` run `omacosy-theme-switch`, which makes
the switch instant and in sync. macOS takes about 4.5 s to paint a new desktop
picture; omacosy instead draws the chosen wallpaper itself, in a desktop-level
window, in about 0.15 s (`helper/overlay.swift`), recolours the bar and the
focus ring the moment it is on screen, and only then asks macOS for the real
wallpaper — hiding the overlay when macOS has caught up with the same picture,
so the handoff is invisible. A quiet pause with no further press
(`OMACOSY_SETTLE_SECONDS`, default 10) is taken as the choice; the wallpaper
request itself is never stacked. It works the same for the four shipped themes
and for `custom`. [docs/theme-switching.md](docs/theme-switching.md) has the
problem, the rejected options and the measurements.

Each theme ships omarchy's full wallpaper set. `Super+Shift+B` (or
`theme-bg-next`) cycles through them; `theme-bg-next <path>` sets any
image you like. Switching themes restarts at the theme's first
wallpaper.

Themes: `tokyo-night`, `catppuccin`, `gruvbox`, `osaka-jade`. Each
`themes/<name>/` holds `colors.toml` (omarchy's 22-color palette),
`sketchybar.sh` / `borders.sh` (bar and ring colors; the file keeps its
omarchy name and format, and the ring uses the theme accent, omarchy's
own convention), and `backgrounds/` (wallpapers from omarchy's
MIT-licensed theme packs). Copy a directory to add one.

### Your own wallpapers, with colors to match

Four themes means four color schemes, and they were chosen to suit their
own wallpapers. A picture of your own gets whichever scheme you were on,
which is how you end up with osaka-jade's dark green pills on a red bar.

Put images in `~/Pictures/wallpapers` and
`Super+Shift+T` reaches a fifth theme, `custom`, after the four. Inside it **every wallpaper is its own
theme**: `Super+Shift+B` moves to the next picture and recomputes the bar
color, the pill color, the icon color and the focus ring from it. On this
theme B walks the Settings grid's own order — your saved variations A→Z
first, then the wallpapers — and wraps, so it steps from a variation into
the next one (or the first wallpaper). The
terminal and its apps follow only when you ask them to (see *Terminal
auto-theme* below).

```sh
mkdir -p ~/Pictures/wallpapers      # install.sh already made it
cp ~/Downloads/walls/*.jpg ~/Pictures/wallpapers/
omacosy-custom-theme status
```

That is the whole setup. With an empty directory the cycle stays four themes
and nothing is printed.

The `Super+,` Settings card shows them as `Wallpaper #N` cards, one per
picture: **Customize** on hover opens a new theme from one in the Theme
Editor, and a saved variation carries a named card of its own with
**Edit**. The editor is complete — Palette Builder, live previews and
Wallpaper Editor: **Save** stores the theme and its edited wallpaper, and
**Apply & Save** puts them on the desktop. Its **Presets** keeps your own
filter presets — **Save Current**, a **Custom** list with delete, and
**Import/Export** in Aether's `aether-presets.json` shape. **Export**
writes a shareable folder — the theme plus its Zed, VS Code, Neovim and
terminal configs — and **Import** reads one back, or a `colors.toml` or a
Base16 scheme; a name already in your library is offered Rename or Replace
([docs/theme-studio.md](docs/theme-studio.md)).

**How the colors are chosen.** The bar's own background keeps the
measurement omacosy already makes to match the real macOS menu bar — a
34-point strip across the top of the picture. Everything else reads the
**whole** image, because a strip across the top is usually sky and says
nothing about the picture: a power-station photo measures near-grey at the
top and orange everywhere else.

The picture's hue is its pixels weighted by saturation x value cubed. The
cube is fitted, not chosen — a moonlit scene that is 61% dark purple by
area and 7% bright blue glow reads as blue, and only the cube agrees.

**A pastel wallpaper gets a pastel theme, a saturated one gets neon.** The
accent's saturation follows the picture rather than a fixed floor: across a
48-image folder, pastel wallpapers average an accent saturation of 0.53 and
saturated ones 0.77.

**The bar and the focus ring always name the same color.** They differ only
in treatment — the ring keeps more of the picture's saturation and stays
brighter, because it is a stroke on a window rather than text on a pill.

Every color is then checked against the surface it sits on and corrected
until it passes: first the luminance gaps the four shipped themes hold,
then WCAG contrast ratios for anything a person reads — text on a pill at
4.5:1, the focused workspace number and the cheat sheet's own text. Pills
are measured against the real wallpaper behind the bar, in eight slices, so
a bright sky in the middle cannot hide a pill sitting on dark slate. The
derivation is pure: the same image always yields the same palette, so a
cached theme and a fresh one cannot disagree.

Optionally, a day and a night theme that follow the macOS appearance, so
sunrise and sunset are macOS's schedule rather than a second one:

```sh
omacosy-custom-theme day   gruvbox
omacosy-custom-theme night osaka-jade/1-glowing-city.webp
omacosy-custom-theme follow on
```

Either may name a shipped theme, one of its wallpapers, or a file of your
own. Full manual: **[docs/derived-themes.md](docs/derived-themes.md)**.

### Terminal auto-theme: your tools follow the wallpaper

Off by default, because a terminal's colors are a personal choice:

```sh
omacosy-term-auto-theme            # status
omacosy-term-auto-theme on         # the terminal and its apps follow the wallpaper theme
omacosy-term-auto-theme off        # they keep their own colors; the desktop still follows
```

**The desktop always follows.** Every wallpaper in `~/Pictures/wallpapers` is
a theme of its own in the `Super+Shift+T` cycle; the bar, the focus ring and
the cheat sheet take its colors with no switch to set. The command above only
decides whether that theme extends to the terminal. It is stored as
`terminal = on | off` in `~/.config/omacosy/term-auto-theme.conf`. Before
2026-10-09 the switch was `omacosy-auto-theme`, and `off` hid the custom
theme entirely; that master switch is gone. It fixed a state where the
Themes tab showed wallpapers the keyboard cycle refused, and where
`Super+Shift+B` could error after an explicit apply. The before/after table
and the full reasoning: [docs/auto-theme.md](docs/auto-theme.md).

While a custom theme is on screen and the terminal follows it, the terminal
and its apps take the colors of the same wallpaper. The 16 terminal colors
are derived from the picture, and red, green, yellow, blue, magenta and cyan
keep their hue, so an error message still reads as red.

A **stock** theme changes none of this. When one is on screen, every generated
file is removed and each app shows its own colors again.

| App | What follows the wallpaper | When it changes | One-time setup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ghostty | background, the 16 colors, cursor, selection | at once, also in new windows | none |
| Starship | the prompt, by role (`err`, `ok`, `accent`, …) | at once | none |
| `ls`, `eza` | the directory color, in the accent | at once | none |
| yazi | directories and folder icons in the accent, markers, borders | when it opens | none |
| btop | meters from green to red, highlights in the accent, the terminal's own background | at once | none |
| Neovim | Aether's colourscheme from the palette, transparent, the accent matching the bar | at once | `omacosy-term-auto-theme on` links the plugin |
| bat, delta | code in the 16 colors | at once | none |
| delta | the added and removed line strips, in the palette's green and red | at once | `[include] path = ~/.config/omacosy/delta.gitconfig` in `~/.gitconfig` |
| fzf, lazygit, fastfetch | accent, borders, selection | the next time they run | none |
| tmux | the band behind the bar takes the terminal's background; a theme plugin keeps its pills | at once | `source-file -q ~/.config/omacosy/tmux-theme.conf` at the end of `tmux.conf` |

With an `applier` (below), Ghostty, Starship and fzf are that tool's job, and
omacosy hands it the palette instead.

Ghostty makes only the terminal's own background transparent, so btop, Neovim
and the tmux band draw on that background instead of painting a color: their
background shows the same transparency as the shell.

neovim, git-delta, tmux and fastfetch are not in the base install;
`./install.sh --tui-tools` adds them.

**Recommended with terminal auto-theme: a transparent terminal.** Add these two lines
to your own Ghostty config, `~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config`,
then quit and reopen Ghostty (on macOS a reload does not change the
transparency):

```
background-opacity = 0.85
background-blur = 10
```

The wallpaper then shows through the terminal, and btop, Neovim and the tmux
band show it too. Use your own config, not omacosy's `~/.config/ghostty/config`:
an update replaces omacosy's file and keeps yours.

**What it writes**, all under `~/.config/omacosy/` unless the path says otherwise:

| File | Read by |
| --- | --- |
| `term-palette.env` | the palette of the theme on screen, `OMACOSY_BG`, `OMACOSY_P0` … `OMACOSY_P15` |
| `ghostty-theme.conf` | Ghostty, through `config-file = ?…` in the shipped config. The `?` makes it optional |
| `starship.toml` | Starship, generated from `config/starship-omacosy.template.toml`, whose colors are named by role |
| `term-env.sh` | `zsh/zshrc`: `EZA_COLORS`, `LS_COLORS`, `BAT_THEME=ansi` for bat and delta, `LG_CONFIG_FILE` for lazygit, a `fastfetch` function with the colors, and, when omacosy owns the prompt, `STARSHIP_CONFIG` and fzf's colors. Your own values come back on a stock theme |
| `lazygit-theme.yml` | lazygit's theme keys only, added after your own `config.yml` |
| `tmux-theme.conf` | tmux, for the band behind the bar |
| `delta.gitconfig` | delta's line strips |
| `nvim/palette.lua` | Neovim, through `config/nvim/omacosy-theme.lua` |
| `~/.config/yazi/theme.toml` | yazi. A `theme.toml` of your own is never overwritten |
| `~/.config/btop/themes/omacosy.theme` | btop, with `color_theme = "omacosy"` in `btop.conf`. A stock theme puts back btop's own theme |

Your own Ghostty config is read **after** the generated one, so a color you
set by hand still wins. `omacosy-term-auto-theme off` deletes the generated files,
and the next window reads your own colors again.

**Handing the terminal to another tool.** `~/.config/omacosy/term-auto-theme.conf`:

```
terminal = on | off           off by default; on: the terminal and its apps follow
applier = <command>           empty: omacosy writes the config itself
```

When `applier` names a command, omacosy writes the palette and then runs
`<command> <palette-file> <theme-label>`, and writes no terminal config of its
own. On a stock theme it runs `<command> --clear <theme-label>`, so that tool
puts back its own colors. That is the hand-off point for a tool that already
owns your terminal's colors, and it keeps exactly one writer: two programs
writing the same Ghostty file would fight, and the winner would depend on the
order the includes are read.

**What it does not touch:** any other program with colors of its own.

Full manual: **[docs/auto-theme.md](docs/auto-theme.md)**.

### yazi and your editor

`Super+Shift+Y` opens **yazi**, a file manager in a terminal window. It tiles
like any other window and wears the theme's colors. It is opt-in:
`./install.sh --yazi` installs it and binds the key, and `--yazi-full` adds
video and raw-photo previews; without a flag, neither happens.

Opening a file from yazi hands it to `$EDITOR`. omacosy sets no editor, so an
unset `$EDITOR` means `vi`, and Vim opened on a **directory** shows its own
file browser, netrw:

```
" Netrw Directory Listing                    (netrw v184)
"   /Users/you/some-dir
```

That screen is Vim, not yazi. Leave it with `:q`. Nothing is modified unless
you type a netrw command such as `D` (delete) or `R` (rename).

To use another editor, set it in `~/.zshrc.local`, which is yours and survives
an update:

```sh
export EDITOR="nvim"        # or: zed --wait, code --wait, hx, micro
```

Only yazi, without touching the shell, is `~/.config/yazi/yazi.toml`:

```toml
[opener]
edit = [ { run = 'nvim "$@"', block = true } ]
```

omacosy writes `~/.config/yazi/theme.toml` while a custom theme is on screen, and
never writes `yazi.toml`, so that file is yours alone.

## Tiling: dwindle

![Three terminals in a dwindle layout — README, git log and btop — accent border ring on the focused one](docs/screenshots/tiling.jpg)

AeroSpace natively inserts new windows as equal siblings, so three
windows become three columns. Hyprland's dwindle splits the focused
window along its own longer edge instead: a new window lands beside a
wide window and below a tall one. That is the omarchy feel, and on a
3440-wide display it is also the difference between a usable third
window and three narrow strips.

AeroSpace cannot express that rule. Its config language has no window
geometry; the format variables are ids, titles and container layouts,
with no width or height anywhere. So the direction is decided in code:
the `on-focus-changed` hook runs `omacosy-helper split-hint`, which
reads the newly focused window's frame and issues
`aerospace split horizontal` or `vertical` on it.

The timing is what matters. The hint lands before the next window
exists, so AeroSpace places that window correctly in its first pass.
An earlier version was a daemon that re-nested windows after AeroSpace
had already placed them, and you could see it: the screen laid out
twice, about 250ms apart. What remains now is the new window's own
first frame, which appears about 150ms before AeroSpace tiles it. No
window manager can place a window that does not exist yet.

Two implementation notes. `enable-normalization-flatten-containers` is
off, because it dissolves the very container `split` creates (AeroSpace
prints a warning saying so if you try). And the hint waits for the
window's frame to hold still before reading it, then names its window
with `--window-id` instead of trusting "the focused window". Both guard
against the same thing: a new window fires the hook too (it takes focus
on open), at a moment when its frame is still the app's default shape
and another window may grab focus before the hint lands. One hook
covers both hover and keyboard focus: AeroSpace notices the focus
`omacosy-ffm` moves, even though ffm moves it through SkyLight.

Manual control (Super+J flips, resize, float) works unchanged.

Floats get a rescue path, because macOS will not keep them on top:
z-order is per app, not per window, so a float sinks behind whichever
app you focus next, and pinning it would need a private call with SIP
off. Instead the bar grows a pill whenever the focused workspace holds
floats, and **Super+S** or a click on that pill surfaces the next one
and brings the cursor with it.

### One window, whole display

Opt-in, off by default: `omacosy-solo-fullscreen on`. A workspace holding a
single tiled window then shows it the way `Super+F` does: the whole display,
no outer gaps. A second window drops back to normal tiling, and closing down
to one goes full again. `omacosy-solo-fullscreen off` hands back every window
it took, and `status` says what it is holding.

`Super+F` keeps its meaning. The rule acts on a workspace's window COUNT, and
pressing `Super+F` changes no count, so a deliberate choice is never undone a
second later; the workspace returns to automatic at the next open or close. A
window counts as the rule's own only when `fullscreen on --fail-if-noop`
actually changed it, so a window you fullscreened by hand is never taken over
and never handed back. Floating windows, and the windows of hidden apps, do
not count — a workspace *showing* one window behaves as one window.

The rule runs in `omacosy-solo`, a small resident daemon under launchd,
rather than on a focus hook. It has to be resident: waking from sleep fires
no focus change and no window event at all, and only a live process receives
the sleep and wake notifications needed to put fullscreen back. It is also
its own process rather than part of `omacosy-bar`, because a Swift trap
cannot be caught and nothing about fullscreening a window should be able to
take the menu bar down. Switched off, the daemon exits and nothing runs.

Under OmniWM there is nothing to switch: its dwindle layout already gives a
lone window the frame its own `Super+F` uses (`singleWindowFit = "fill"`).

## Two window managers (OmniWM option, beta)

AeroSpace is the default. [OmniWM](https://github.com/BarutSRB/OmniWM)
is a newer, signed-and-notarized tiling WM with a native dwindle
layout — omacosy can run on either, and switching is one command:

```sh
omacosy-wm-switch omniwm      # installs OmniWM on first use, then
                              # switches with a guarded handover
omacosy-wm-switch aerospace   # the way back, and installs AeroSpace
                              # on first use after ./install.sh --omniwm
```

The switch checks itself: it snapshots your windows, stops AeroSpace,
starts OmniWM and waits until OmniWM manages them. On a first switch,
grant OmniWM's permissions when macOS asks. If OmniWM does not take
over within 2 minutes, or you press Ctrl-C, the switch reverts to
AeroSpace and puts your windows back.

Under OmniWM everything keeps working — bar, overview (with
type-to-search), gestures, keybindings, themes — and the dwindle
layout is native, so the split-hint machinery below simply isn't
needed there. What changes: OmniWM draws the focus border (themed by
theme-set), app-launching chords run through Karabiner rules that the
switch installs and removes, and Super+Space opens OmniWM's command
palette instead of Raycast.

Under OmniWM the plumbing changes shape: `Super+N`/`Hyper+N` route
through Karabiner into `omacosy-omni` (a held-socket IPC client) so
slots resolve on the display under your cursor — OmniWM's native
hotkeys are name-global and would always hit the main set — at the
cost of ~40 ms per chord. `Hyper+arrows` swap tiles; OmniWM's own
directional move *stacks* windows into a group, which stays available
on `ctrl+opt+shift+arrows`.

Honesty section: the upstream author daily-drives this option (0.6.4,
docked multi-monitor, each display running its own nine workspaces),
and this build runs it daily on one display. docs/omniwm-port.md
carries a ledger of upstream
quirks found while porting — read it before assuming a weird layout is
omacosy's fault. AeroSpace remains the longer-tested default.

## Focus follows mouse & swipes

Under the OmniWM option this daemon is parked: OmniWM's native
focus-follows-mouse (with warp-to-focus and hover-raise) replaces it.
Under AeroSpace, `omacosy-ffm`: hover focuses, with no raise over floating windows, so
floats stay in front. It is event-driven off mouse movement, so a
parked cursor never steals focus from a launching window. It never
changes focus during drags, and never through an always-on-top panel:
hovering a Touch ID prompt leaves focus exactly where it is instead of
falling through to the window beneath. Per-app opt-out lives in
`config/ffm-ignore` (omarchy's JetBrains-style exception).

4-finger swipes left/right switch workspaces on the display under the
cursor (native-Spaces semantics), with wrap-around, on any trackpad.
The system's own trackpad swipes (both the three- and four-finger
gestures) are disabled by `macos-defaults.sh` so Mission Control never
fights the daemon; `uninstall.sh` and `omacosy-toggle off` restore them
(macOS may need a log out/in before a trackpad gesture re-arms).

## Workspace overview

![Workspace overview — live preview cards over the zoomed-out wallpaper, chips for empty workspaces](docs/screenshots/overview.jpg)

4-finger **swipe up**: the wallpaper breathes in behind a dim wash and
every non-empty workspace of the cursor's monitor gets a card
(per-display Mission Control semantics), with live window previews
(ScreenCaptureKit, composed into the tile layout), app icons, and an
accent ring on the focused workspace. Click a card or press its digit
to jump; empty workspaces show as small chips, and digits work for them
too. **Swipe down**, Esc, or a backdrop click dismisses. It is a
resident daemon, so it opens instantly.

**Type to search** while it is open: a search pill filters cards to
matching window titles and apps as you type, `Enter` jumps to the
first hit, `Esc` clears the filter before it closes the overview.
Digits type into an active filter instead of switching, so numeric
titles stay reachable.

**Drag a card** to reorganize: the row makes room as you move, and the
drop slides everything between the old and new position over by one.
Workspaces cannot be renamed or resequenced in either WM (the name is
the position), so what actually moves is their windows, which means a
split layout inside a moved workspace comes back as a flat row. Dropping a
card on an empty chip moves that workspace there instead.

## Parking the setup

`omacosy-toggle off` returns to a vanilla Mac in one command (AeroSpace
stops managing, all daemons and the bar stop, and the native menu bar
and 4-finger swipes go back to macOS) without uninstalling;
`omacosy-toggle on` brings everything back. No argument flips.

## Memory use

About **157MB** of physical footprint (what Activity Monitor calls
Memory) across WM, bar, three background daemons, the gesture daemon and
Karabiner, measured by upstream, docked to a second display. Resident set size reads
~322MB, but RSS counts each process's share of the same shared system
frameworks more than once, so footprint is the number to compare.
(Measured in AeroSpace mode; OmniWM mode is a wash — its ~44MB WM
replaces AeroSpace plus the parked `omacosy-ffm`.)
Largest first:

| | footprint | RSS |
|---|---|---|
| `omacosy-overview` | 36MB | 46MB |
| `omacosy-bar` | 32MB | 55MB |
| AeroSpace | 24MB | 85MB |
| Karabiner (4 processes) | 24MB | 61MB |
| `omacosy-borders` | 19MB | 29MB |
| `omacosy-gesture` | 13MB | 22MB |
| `omacosy-ffm` | 10MB | 24MB |

On one display the same set measured ~155MB; the bar and the border
overlay each draw per-screen, and AeroSpace carries a second workspace
set. The figures move with uptime. `omacosy-overview` caches a
half-resolution capture per window shown, so it starts near 9MB and
settles around 37MB; it plateaus there rather than climbing, because
the cache is refiltered to the visible set on each open. AeroSpace
drifts the other way, reading higher the longer it runs. Packaging the
bar as an `.app` (which is what unlocks the wi-fi network name) cost
about 1MB; the bundle is a directory and an Info.plist, not a second
copy of anything.

## Back to a normal Mac

```sh
~/.local/share/omacosy/uninstall.sh
```

If you cloned omacosy somewhere else, run `<your clone>/uninstall.sh`.
The script finds the clone from its own path.

Manifest-driven: `install.sh` records what this machine actually gained
(Homebrew packages that weren't already present, cloned repos, every
`defaults` key's prior value), and `uninstall.sh` removes and restores
exactly that. Tools and settings you had before omacosy are never
touched. Pre-manifest installs fall back to a conservative teardown
that leaves all Homebrew packages in place.

Before it removes anything, the script saves your omacosy settings, the
record of this install and your `karabiner.json` in
`~/omacosy-backup-<date>-<time>/`. It prints that folder's path at the end.

During the script, it lists the apps and tools omacosy installed and asks
which ones to keep. Use the arrow keys to move, space to mark or unmark
an item, `a` to mark all, and enter when you are done. The script then
shows what it keeps and what it removes: `y` continues, `n` goes back to
the list. It removes the others and names each one it could not remove.

After the script, do these steps in this order:

1. Close the terminal window and open a new one. The old window still
   uses omacosy's shell setup, and some of the programs it calls are gone.
2. Optional: delete the clone. The script keeps it, and nothing breaks
   if it stays. With the clone kept, a reinstall is one command. To
   delete it, run `rm -rf <your clone>`. The default clone is
   `~/.local/share/omacosy`.
3. If omacosy installed Homebrew, the script says so. To remove Homebrew
   too, use Homebrew's own uninstall script. Homebrew packages you had
   before omacosy stay installed.
4. In System Settings → General → Login Items, remove AeroSpace if it is
   still in the list.
5. If you used the Caps Lock dictation shortcut in the Claude desktop app,
   turn it on again in Claude's settings. The install removed it.
6. Optional: in System Settings → Privacy & Security, delete the entries
   omacosy added. The script removes those of the bar, `omacosy-gesture`
   and `omacosy-ffm`. The others stay, `omacosy-overview` among them. The
   [permissions table](#permissions) lists each one and the program it
   names. They do nothing once the programs are gone.
7. Log out and log in again. The native menu bar comes back fully only
   then.
