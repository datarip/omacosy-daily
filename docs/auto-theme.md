# Terminal auto-theme: the terminal and its apps follow your wallpaper

The desktop side is always on: every wallpaper in `~/Pictures/wallpapers` is a
theme of its own ([derived-themes.md](derived-themes.md)), and the bar, the
focus ring and the cheat sheet take its colours. This command decides one
thing — whether that theme also extends to the terminal and its apps: Ghostty,
the Starship prompt, the directory colour in `ls` and `eza`, yazi, btop,
Neovim, bat, delta and its line strips, fzf, lazygit, fastfetch, and the band
behind tmux's bar.

Off by default, because a terminal's colours are a personal choice.

```sh
omacosy-term-auto-theme            # status
omacosy-term-auto-theme on         # the terminal and its apps follow the wallpaper theme
omacosy-term-auto-theme off        # they keep their own colours
```

**`on`** writes the generated files again and links the Neovim plugin back.
**`off`** removes every generated file, puts back the settings it replaced
(btop's `color_theme`, the shell variables) and resets the colours of open
terminals (OSC 104, 110, 111, 112) or runs `<applier> --clear <label>`. The
desktop, the bar, the ring and the cheat sheet follow the wallpaper in both
states. Stored as `terminal = on | off` in
`~/.config/omacosy/term-auto-theme.conf`.

## What changed on 2026-10-09

The switch used to be a master. `omacosy-auto-theme off` hid the custom theme
from the cycle, refused the wallpaper list, day/night and the editor, and left
the desktop frozen on a stock theme; `on desktop-only` existed to tease the
desktop and the terminal apart. Now the desktop always follows and only the
terminal is optional — one choice instead of a mode matrix:

| | before (`omacosy-auto-theme off`) | after (`omacosy-term-auto-theme off`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| custom theme in the cycle | hidden | always, when pictures exist |
| wallpaper list, day/night, editor | refused | always work |
| bar, ring, cheat sheet | frozen on the stock theme | follow the wallpaper |
| terminal tools | own colours | own colours |
| `on` | desktop + terminal | the terminal follows too |

The problems this fixes, all found while building the Theme Studio:

- the wallpaper list was always visible while the cycle silently dropped
  `custom` — two different answers to the same question;
- after applying a wallpaper from the Studio with the old switch off,
  `Super+Shift+B` errored with "theme has no backgrounds": an explicit
  action had created a state the keyboard paths could not handle;
- a `day=`/`night=` value naming one of your wallpapers was refused;
- `off` and `on desktop-only` both meant "the terminal keeps its own
  colours", but only one kept the desktop — a distinction with no value to
  the user;
- a developer could not keep a hand-built terminal theme (starship, tmux,
  btop, Neovim) without giving up the wallpaper-driven desktop.

The rename and the semantics follow the Theme Studio, whose premise is that
every wallpaper is an auto-theme, always visible and editable, and whose rule
is that a hand-built terminal theme must be safe: choosing `off` keeps it,
and the desktop still follows. Earlier files are migrated on first use —
`auto-theme.conf` (or `term.conf` before it) is read once and replaced by
`term-auto-theme.conf` with a `terminal` key. Nothing else carries over,
because the desktop no longer has a switch.

`theme-set`, `theme-bg-next` and `omacosy-theme-switch` call
`omacosy-term-auto-theme apply <label>` after they repoint
`~/.config/omarchy/current/theme`. Nothing else calls it, except tmux, which
runs `omacosy-term-auto-theme tmux-bar` from its own config.

The two theme keys run `omacosy-theme-switch` (README, Themes), which applies
this in step with the instant wallpaper switch: the terminal and its tools are
told at the same moment the bar and ring are recoloured, instead of waiting
for macOS to paint the wallpaper.

**A stock theme is never changed.** When one of the shipped themes is on
screen, `apply` removes every generated file, puts back the settings it
replaced (btop's `color_theme`, the shell variables), resets the colours of
open terminals (OSC 104, 110, 111, 112) or runs `<applier> --clear <label>`,
and makes Ghostty and tmux read their own config again. Each app shows its own
colours.

- [7. What it does not touch](#7-what-it-does-not-touch)

**Recommended: a transparent terminal.** The apps above draw on the terminal's
own background so that Ghostty's transparency shows through them. Ghostty is
opaque by default; two lines in your own Ghostty config,
`~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config`, turn it on:

```
background-opacity = 0.85
background-blur = 10
```

On macOS, Ghostty applies a change to `background-opacity` only after a full
restart, so quit and reopen it. This is a setting of yours, not of
auto-theme: it stays the same on every theme.

## 1. Where the colors come from

`omacosy-term-palette <theme-dir> <out.env> [<label>]` reads the theme that is
on screen and writes one palette file.

**A shipped theme** (`themes/<name>/`) carries `colors.toml`, a designer's own
16 colors, and they are used as they are. `omacosy-term-auto-theme` never asks for
this: a stock theme leaves the terminal alone.

**A computed theme** (a wallpaper of your own) has no `colors.toml`, so the 16
colors are derived from the palette `omacosy-derive` already wrote:

- Six hues carry meaning and stay FIXED: red 29, green 142, yellow 95, blue
  258, magenta 328, cyan 210 degrees in OKLCH. Each is nudged at most 15
  degrees toward the accent, so the set belongs to the picture without red
  ceasing to be red. This is where `pywal` and its kin fail: filling all 16
  slots from the image makes a beige photograph print errors in beige.
- Their chroma follows the picture, so a pastel wallpaper gets a pastel set.
- Every one is then pushed in lightness until it reaches 4.5:1 against the
  background.
- A separate **operator** role is derived for syntax: it starts at the
  bright-blue slot and, only when that sits too close to the variable
  foreground or the number colour, moves to the hue furthest from the whole
  syntax set. It must still reach 4.5:1 on the background. The editor exports
  use the same rule.
- The background itself is the theme's surface, pushed AWAY from the text until
  the text reads at 8:1. A terminal cannot be mid-tone: a dusty pink bar at
  relative luminance 0.19 would force every color to run to white or black.
  Which way it runs is the theme's own answer — light text means a dark
  terminal. That background is then rounded once to the 8-bit hex the terminal
  actually draws, and every other colour is derived from that exact value, not
  from the unrounded intermediate.

## 2. The palette file

`~/.config/omacosy/term-palette.env`, one `KEY='#rrggbb'` per line, meant to be
sourced by a shell.

| Key | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `OMACOSY_THEME` | the theme's name, for a label |
| `OMACOSY_BG`, `OMACOSY_FG` | terminal background and foreground |
| `OMACOSY_CURSOR`, `OMACOSY_CURSOR_TEXT` | cursor and the text under it |
| `OMACOSY_SEL_BG`, `OMACOSY_SEL_FG` | selection |
| `OMACOSY_P0` … `OMACOSY_P15` | the 16 ANSI colors, by number |
| `OMACOSY_BLACK` … `OMACOSY_BR_WHITE` | the same 16, by name |
| `OMACOSY_ACCENT`, `OMACOSY_ALT` | the theme's accent, and a second one |
| `OMACOSY_OK`, `OMACOSY_WARN`, `OMACOSY_ERR`, `OMACOSY_INFO`, `OMACOSY_PEACH` | the roles a prompt uses, so a template says `err` and not `red` |
| `OMACOSY_OPERATOR` | the syntax operator role: kept clear of the variable and number colours, 4.5:1 on the background |
| `OMACOSY_MUTED` | dimmed text |
| `OMACOSY_IS_DARK` | 1 on a dark terminal, 0 on a light one |

A saved edition can also pin the base syntax roles. Those do not live in this
file; they arrive through `overrides.env` as `OMACOSY_SYNTAX_<role>` (and the
operator as `OMACOSY_OPERATOR`), layered over the palette. The Neovim writer
asks `omacosy-themecore palette syntax` for the token map, so the live
`nvim/palette.lua` carries the same Classic / Grouped / Neighboring /
Expressive variants as the editor exports.

No surface ramp is written. A consumer that wants one derives it from the
background, the foreground and `OMACOSY_MUTED`.

## 3. Who applies it

`~/.config/omacosy/term-auto-theme.conf` (`auto-theme.conf`, and `term.conf`
before it, are read once and moved into it):

```
terminal = on | off           off by default; on: the terminal and its apps follow
applier = <command>           empty: omacosy writes the config itself
```

**omacosy as the applier** writes these files, under `~/.config/omacosy/`
unless the path says otherwise. The ones marked *both* are also written
when another tool is the applier, because no terminal palette reaches them:

| File | Read by |
| --- | --- |
| `ghostty-theme.conf` | Ghostty, through `config-file = ?~/.config/omacosy/ghostty-theme.conf` in the shipped config |
| `starship.toml` | Starship, generated from `config/starship-omacosy.template.toml` plus the palette |
| `term-env.sh` | `zsh/zshrc`: `EZA_COLORS`, `LS_COLORS`, `BAT_THEME=ansi` (bat and delta then draw in the 16 colours), `STARSHIP_CONFIG`, fzf's `--color` added to your own `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`, `LG_CONFIG_FILE` for lazygit, and a `fastfetch` function that adds the colours as options. Your own values are kept and put back on a stock theme, and a `fastfetch` function of your own is never replaced |
| `lazygit-theme.yml` | lazygit, as the last file in `LG_CONFIG_FILE`: only the `gui.theme` keys, so your own `config.yml` keeps everything else. lazygit refuses to start when a named file is missing, so your `config.yml` is named only when it exists. *Both* |
| `delta.gitconfig` | delta's line strips, through an include in `~/.gitconfig`. *Both* |
| `tmux-theme.conf` | tmux, through `source-file -q` at the end of `tmux.conf`. *Both* |
| `nvim/palette.lua` | Neovim, through `config/nvim/omacosy-theme.lua`. *Both* |
| `~/.config/yazi/theme.toml` | yazi. *Both* |
| `~/.config/btop/themes/omacosy.theme` | btop, through `color_theme = "omacosy"` in `btop.conf`. *Both* |

The `?` makes Ghostty's include optional, so a machine that never turns this on
reads no such file. Your own config is read after it, so a color you set by hand
still wins.

**Another tool as the applier.** omacosy runs `<command> <palette-file>
<theme-label>` on a custom theme and `<command> --clear <theme-label>` on a
stock one, and writes no terminal config of its own, not even a stale file
an include could pick up. It still writes `term-env.sh` for the directory
color and `BAT_THEME`, which are nobody else's job, and it still repaints open
windows. The prompt and fzf's colours are left to the applier.

This exists to keep exactly ONE writer. Two programs writing Ghostty's config
would fight, and the winner would depend on the order the includes are read.

### yazi

yazi ignores the terminal's 16 colours: its default theme names its own blues
and cyans, so a themed terminal still showed a blue file list. The generated
`theme.toml` gives it the palette, and a directory — name and folder glyph —
wears the ACCENT, the colour the bar and the focus ring already name.

yazi MERGES a user theme over its defaults, so only the keys written here
change; the icon table's 650 entries for file types stay. Two things learned
from yazi's own error messages, kept so they are not learned twice:

- A filetype rule needs `url` or `mime`; `is` only qualifies one of them, and a
  directory is the url pattern `*/`. Without that, yazi refuses to start:
  "at least one of `url` or `mime` must be specified".
- The folder GLYPH is coloured by the icon table, not by the filetype rules.
  Colouring the rules alone leaves accent names next to blue icons.

A `theme.toml` of your own is never touched: the file is only written when it
is missing or when its first line says omacosy wrote it. `omacosy-term-auto-theme
off` deletes ours and leaves yours.

yazi reads its theme when it starts, so a window that is already open keeps
the old colours until you reopen it.

**Why not palette slot names, which would update live.** Tried, and it works:
a name means "the terminal's slot N", and repainting those slots is what this
script already does to every live window, so an open yazi recoloured on a theme
switch. Two things sank it. A slot is only the NEAREST of 16 — gruvbox's orange
accent lands on yellow — and the CHOICE is frozen at startup: a window opened
under gruvbox keeps drawing "yellow", which after a switch to catppuccin is
cream. The colour stayed live and stopped being the accent. The palette file
still carries `OMACOSY_ACCENT_ANSI`, the nearest slot by name, for a consumer
that would rather have live colour than an exact one.

### btop

btop paints itself from a theme file too. The CPU, temperature and memory
meters run from `OK` to `WARN` to `ERR`, because load has a meaning, as red
does in the terminal. The highlights take the accent. Box outlines, dividers
and meter backgrounds are the accent or the dimmed text, mixed toward the
background. `main_bg` is left empty, so btop draws on the terminal's own
background: Ghostty makes only that background transparent, and draws any
colour a program paints fully solid.

On a custom theme, `color_theme` in `btop.conf` is set to `omacosy`, and
btop's own value is kept in `~/.local/state/omacosy/btop-color-theme`. A
stock theme puts it back, but only while `btop.conf` still names `omacosy`: a
theme chosen in btop's menu since then stays. An `omacosy.theme` of your own,
without the first line omacosy writes, is never touched.

A running btop changes at once: `SIGUSR2` makes it read `btop.conf` and the
theme file again. That also matters when it quits, because btop writes
`btop.conf` on exit. After the reload, the value it writes is the new one.

### delta's line strips

`BAT_THEME=ansi` colours the code in a diff, but the strips behind added and
removed lines are delta's own dark green and dark red. On a light terminal
they sit under dark text, which then cannot be read. delta reads those styles
only from git's config, so omacosy writes `~/.config/omacosy/delta.gitconfig`
and `~/.gitconfig` includes it:

```
[include]
	path = ~/.config/omacosy/delta.gitconfig
```

git skips an include whose file is missing, so on a stock theme delta uses its
own colours again.

Each strip is built in OKLCH, not mixed in sRGB. A mix of the palette's green
into a blue background came out teal, and red into a light background came
out brown: tested on 10 wallpapers, both stopped reading as added and removed.
So the hue is the palette's green or red held within 8 degrees of pure green
(142) and pure red (29), the lightness is the background's moved by 0.07 away
from black or white (at least 0.29 on a dark terminal), and the chroma is
0.075, lowered only as far as sRGB requires. The word-level highlights use a
step of 0.14 and a chroma of 0.12. On those 10 wallpapers the text on a strip
reads at 7.4:1 or more.

## 4. Windows that are already open, and the next one

Ghostty reads its config when it starts, not when it opens a window. So after
every switch `omacosy-term-auto-theme` sends `SIGUSR2` to each Ghostty process,
which makes it read its config again; without that, a window opened after a
switch took the colours Ghostty had at its start.

A config file does not repaint a window that is open, so `omacosy-term-auto-theme`
also writes the colors to the tty of every shell as escape sequences (OSC 4,
10, 11 and 12). The terminal consumes them, so a shell running Neovim or yazi
is unharmed.

The prompt needs one more step. Starship builds its prompt string when it draws
a prompt, so the one on screen keeps the old colors. `omacosy-term-auto-theme` sends
SIGWINCH, and `zsh/zshrc` traps it, re-runs Starship's own precmd and redraws
the line.

Two details that cost an afternoon, kept here so they are not learned twice:

- A login shell is called `-zsh`, not `zsh`. A filter matching `zsh` or
  `/bin/zsh` finds nothing, and no window is repainted.
- Karabiner runs a keybinding with `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`. A command in
  `~/.local/bin` is not found there, so anything looked up by name alone
  silently does nothing when the theme switch comes from the keyboard.

## 5. Neovim

`omacosy-term-auto-theme on` links `config/nvim/omacosy-theme.lua` into
`~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/`, the folder a lazy.nvim config (LazyVim,
kickstart) loads plugins from. `off` removes the link. A file of your own with
that name is never replaced or removed. Without that folder nothing is linked,
and the palette file below is still there to use by hand.

**The plugin.** `config/nvim/omacosy-theme.lua` is a lazy.nvim spec for
Aether's colourscheme, [`omacom/aether.nvim`](https://github.com/omacom/aether.nvim)
(branch `v3`), which lazy.nvim installs on first load.

**The palette.** On a custom theme omacosy writes
`~/.config/omacosy/nvim/palette.lua`: a `colors` table under Aether's role
names (`background`, `foreground`, `muted`, `lighter_bg`, `dark_bg`,
`darker_bg`, `dark_fg`, `light_fg`, `bright_fg`, `red`, `yellow`, `orange`,
`operator`, `green`, `cyan`, `blue`, `purple`, `brown`, the six `bright_*`,
`accent`, `cursor`, `selection`, `selection_foreground`,
`selection_background`). Any config can read it with `dofile()`.

**The colourscheme.** The plugin hands that table to `aether.setup`; Aether
paints every group from it. `accent` is the theme's own accent, so Neovim's
accent matches the bar and the focus ring: Aether's ANSI blue slot for a
palette theme built in the Theme Studio, and the picture's derived role accent
for a Magic (wallpaper) theme. Aether has no operator key, so the plugin names
`@operator` and `@keyword.operator` itself from the `operator` colour, which
keeps `+ - * / < >` distinct from variables and numbers. An edition's
**Syntax Variety** travels as a `syntax` file beside `colors.toml`, so the live
Neovim palette follows the same Grouped / Neighboring / Expressive choice as
the editor exports. `transparent = true`,
with transparent sidebars and
floats, keeps the editor's background the terminal's, so Ghostty's opacity shows
through. The LazyVim dashboard logo (the `SnacksDashboardHeader` group), which
Aether links to `Title`, is pointed at the accent too.

**Following a switch.** The plugin watches `~/.config/omacosy/nvim/` — the
folder, not the file, because omacosy replaces the file with a rename and a
watch on a file stops after the first rename — and re-runs `aether.setup` on
every change, so an open Neovim follows a theme switch. On a stock theme the
file is deleted and the colourscheme your config set at startup comes back. It
applies at `VimEnter`, after your config, so that scheme is the one remembered.


**One plugin only.** Some terminal-theme tools ship a Neovim plugin that also
sets the colourscheme from a palette. Two such plugins fight over it, so keep
one of the two.

## 6. tmux

tmux keeps its own bar, from `tmux.conf` or a theme plugin. Only the band
behind the bar changes: the colour it is painted on becomes the terminal's
background.

A theme plugin such as tmux-tokyo-night writes fixed colours into the text of
the bar and takes no colours from outside. So `omacosy-term-auto-theme tmux-bar`,
run by tmux itself, reads the band colour from `status-style` after the bar is
drawn. As a background it becomes `default`, the terminal's own, with its
transparency. As a text colour it draws the arrows between a pill and the
band, so it becomes the terminal's background colour. The pills keep their
colours: without knowing what each colour means, moving them to the palette
is a guess.

On each switch omacosy reads `tmux.conf` again in every running server, so the
bar is first what it draws on its own, and then the band is replaced. On a
stock theme only the first step runs, and the band comes back.

A server that starts later needs one line at the end of `tmux.conf`, after a
plugin manager's `run` line:

```
source-file -q ~/.config/omacosy/tmux-theme.conf
```

`-q` keeps tmux silent while the file does not exist: on a stock theme, and
while the terminal keeps its own colours.

## 7. Exporting the generated configs

`omacosy-themecore theme export <id> --bundle DIR` writes a shareable copy of a
saved theme: its record, a flat `colors.toml`, and the app configs — the ones
this command generates, plus Zed, VS Code and `neovim.lua`. It runs the **same
writers**, but into `DIR` and with every live action suppressed: no window is
repainted, no Ghostty or tmux reload fires, `btop.conf` is untouched, and the
machine's own tool opacity is not baked in. Every app is written whether or not
it is installed here, so a bundle is complete.

`omacosy-term-auto-theme export-theme <dir> <out-dir> [<label>] [<syntax>]` is
the writer-facing half; run it directly with a directory holding a
`colors.toml` (and an `overrides.env` when the theme has per-app overrides or
syntax pins). `theme export` passes the record's `palette.syntax` as the last
argument. The exported `term-env.sh` and
`tmux-theme.conf` are self-contained — colour exports and a `status-style` — so
a bundle never points back at the machine that made it.

## 8. What it does not touch

Any other program with colours of its own. `omacosy-term-auto-theme off`
deletes the generated files; the next window reads your own colours again.
