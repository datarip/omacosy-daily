# Customising omacosy

This page tells you where your own settings go, and what `install.sh`
resets each time it runs.

## 1. What install.sh owns, and what is yours

`install.sh` regenerates or re-copies these files on every run. An edit
you make to one of them is gone after the next install.

| File | On every `install.sh` run |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml` | regenerated from `config/aerospace/aerospace.template.toml` |
| `~/.config/omniwm/settings.toml` | regenerated from `config/omniwm/settings.template.toml` |
| `~/.config/omacosy/borders.conf` | re-copied from `config/borders.conf` |
| `~/.config/omacosy/ffm-ignore`, `~/.config/omacosy/gesture.json` | re-copied from the clone |
| `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json` | re-copied from the clone |

These files are yours. `install.sh` creates them once, or never, and does
not overwrite them:

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.config/omacosy/settings.conf` | app choices, workspace rules, float rules, ring radius, window corners |
| `~/.config/omacosy/bar.conf` | bar auto-hide, where the top edge splits, the slide time |
| `~/.config/omacosy/solo-fullscreen` | its presence turns the one-window fullscreen on |
| `~/.config/omacosy/themes.conf` | the custom theme's wallpaper directory, and the day/night choices. Optional — absent means `~/Pictures/wallpapers` and no day/night |
| `~/.zshrc.local` | your shell config |

`omacosy-settings` reads `settings.conf` and writes your values back into
the files `install.sh` resets. Run it after every install:

```sh
./install.sh && omacosy-settings
```

Under OmniWM there is a second reason. `install.sh` starts AeroSpace and
resets the Karabiner rules that OmniWM's chords need. `omacosy-settings`
quits that AeroSpace and puts the rules back.

## 2. Find a bundle id

A workspace rule names an app by its bundle id. Ask macOS for it, with
the app's name as it shows in `/Applications`, without `.app`:

```sh
osascript -e 'id of app "Safari"'
# com.apple.Safari
```

## 3. Put your apps on your workspaces

`APP_WORKSPACE_RULES` in `settings.conf` holds one rule per line:
`<bundle id> <workspace>`. To send Visual Studio Code to workspace 4,
find its bundle id:

```sh
osascript -e 'id of app "Visual Studio Code"'
# com.microsoft.VSCode
```

Add a line to the list:

```sh
APP_WORKSPACE_RULES="
com.apple.Safari        1
com.apple.mail          2
com.apple.Terminal      3
com.microsoft.VSCode    4
"
```

Then apply it:

```sh
./install.sh && omacosy-settings
```

Under AeroSpace, `omacosy-settings` appends the rules to
`aerospace.toml` once. A changed list needs the fresh `aerospace.toml`
that `install.sh` writes. Under OmniWM, `omacosy-settings` alone adds a
new rule and corrects a changed one. It does not remove a rule. List the
rules with `omniwmctl query rules`, and remove one with
`omniwmctl rule remove <id>`.

A rule applies when a window opens. Windows that are already open stay
where they are.

`APP_FLOAT_RULES` lists the windows that float instead of tile, one per
line: a bundle id, or `title:` followed by part of the window title.
OmniWM reads this list. AeroSpace takes its float rules from its own
template.

The same file sets the apps the four launch chords open: `TERMINAL`,
`BROWSER`, `MUSIC` and `MESSENGER`. Give the app's name. An empty value
keeps the default from `config/apps.conf`. A changed app takes effect
after `./install.sh && omacosy-settings`.

`SERIALIZE_APP_SPAWNS="1"` sends the music and messenger chords through
`omacosy-spawn-cmd`, so a burst of presses opens one window at a time.

## 4. The focus ring and the window corners

The ring colour comes from the theme. Change it with `theme-set <name>`
or Super+Shift+T.

The ring radius is `RING_RADIUS` in `settings.conf`. The ring sits
concentric with a window when:

```
ring radius = window corner radius + gap + width / 2
```

`gap` and `width` are in `~/.config/omacosy/borders.conf`.

`WINDOW_CORNER` sets the radius macOS draws every window's corners with.
Empty leaves the macOS default alone. When it is set, the ring radius
follows it by the rule above, and `RING_RADIUS` is not used. To try a
value before you put it in `settings.conf`:

```sh
omacosy-window-corners square      # 0.1, square corners
omacosy-window-corners 8           # any radius from 0 to 64
omacosy-window-corners round       # back to the macOS default
omacosy-window-corners             # show what is set now
```

An app reads the corner radius when it opens a window. Relaunch an app to
see the new corners.

## 5. Keep your shell config

`install.sh` writes `~/.zshrc` once, as a short stub file that loads
omacosy's shell setup. Put your own config in `~/.zshrc.local`. The
omacosy shell setup loads it.

If you had a `~/.zshrc` before, `install.sh` copied it to
`~/.zshrc.local` and kept a backup of the original. If `~/.zshrc.local`
already existed, the old `~/.zshrc` was not merged into it. The install
said so, and named the backup.

Installers append to `~/.zshrc`. Those lines land in your own file, not
in the clone, and `install.sh` never rewrites them. To move them into
`~/.zshrc.local`:

```sh
omacosy-harvest-zshrc
```

The first run adds a marker line to the end of `~/.zshrc` and moves
nothing. After that, each run moves the lines below the marker. Lines
that were in `~/.zshrc` before the first run stay above the marker, so
run it once soon after the install. It backs up both files to
`~/.local/state/omacosy-harvest/` before it writes.

## 6. What survives a re-install

| File | `install.sh` | `omacosy-settings` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `~/.config/omacosy/settings.conf` | kept | reads it |
| `~/.config/omacosy/bar.conf` | kept | reads `autohide` |
| `~/.config/omacosy/solo-fullscreen` | kept | — |
| the `~/.zshrc` stub, and lines appended to it | kept | — |
| `~/.zshrc.local` | kept | — |
| `aerospace.toml` | regenerated | writes your values back |
| OmniWM `settings.toml` | regenerated | writes your rules back, under OmniWM |
| `~/.config/omacosy/borders.conf` | re-copied | writes the ring radius back |
| `config/apps.local.conf` in the clone | read | rewritten from `settings.conf` |
| the window corner preference | kept | set from `WINDOW_CORNER` |

A hand edit to a regenerated or re-copied file is lost at the next
install. Put the value in `settings.conf` instead.

## 7. Undo all of it

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

It removes what `install.sh` added, and restores what it replaced:

- the commands in `~/.local/bin`, the launch agents and the configs;
- `~/.zshrc`: the stub is removed and your earlier `~/.zshrc` comes
  back. If you added lines to the stub, it is kept as a backup;
- `~/.zshrc.local`: removed only if `install.sh` made it and it is still
  an exact copy of your restored `~/.zshrc`. Otherwise it is kept;
- `~/.config/omacosy/settings.conf`: removed only if `install.sh` made
  it and you never edited it;
- the Homebrew packages that `install.sh` added. Packages you had before
  stay;
- the window corners: both corner keys are deleted, so macOS draws its
  own corners again. An app shows them after a relaunch.
